(ns sieve)
;; I don't like my solution, I think it consume to much memory and redo to much calculation.
;; Obviously I could have take another approach, but I have sticked to this one because I find interesting the functions fmap, fmap-key and mark
;; I'm pretty sure that I will find a one liner in community solution ðŸ™‚.
